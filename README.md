## REST Easy

REST Easy is a Firefox add-on that provides a full-featured REST client in the browser.
It is still a work in progress, but the features currently implemented include:

 - support for all common HTTP methods
 - parameter editor supporting both `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data`
 - ability to specify arbitrary data for POST and PUT requests
 - preview of HTML both as text and rendered in the browser
 - syntax highlighting for HTML, JavaScript/JSON, and XML

Features planned for upcoming releases include:

 - tools for saving and loading requests

### Get Involved

Interested in helping out with REST Easy development?
We'd love to have you contribute!
Just fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
Here are some of the areas we would like some help in:

 - **JavaScript programmers:** the following features are still in the planning stages:

     - loading and saving requests
     - preview of more file types
     - ability to specify a file to upload with a POST or PUT request

 - **Theme designers:** our current theme is written in LESS and compiled on-the-fly to CSS in the browser.
   Although the current theme is usable, we welcome improvements.

 - **Localization:** the add-on has already been translated into a few languages, but we're always excited to add support for more languages.
   All translations for other languages are welcome.
