## REST Easy

REST Easy is a Firefox add-on that provides a full-featured REST client in the browser. It is still a work in progress, but some of the planned features include:

 - support for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
 - ability to add/modify request headers
 - POST parameter editor
 - tools for saving and loading requests
